## Overview

ResHelp Tools is a collection of Python-based utilities designed to assist researchers in their work. 

## Features

### Main Tool (main.py)

- Provides an introduction to ResHelp Tools.
- Allows users to select from a list of available tools.
- Currently supports one tool: SDF 3D Conformer Downloader.

### SDF 3D Conformer Downloader (pubchemsdf.py)

- Downloads SDF files of molecules with provided names from a text file to a specified location.
- Supports two input options:
  - Manual entry of chemical names.
  - Upload of a .txt file containing chemical names.
- Downloads 3D conformer SDF files from PubChem for the specified chemicals.

### Adding Hydrogen to Molecules tool

- Asks user for location of SDF files
- In the software PyMOL, adds hydrogen to each molecule and saves the file in .pdb format
- Command used in PyMOL : h_add
- Location of PyMOL should be : C:\ProgramData\pymol\PyMOLWin.exe\

### Docking Tools (dokcing.py)

- Performs molecular docking simulations using AutoDock Vina and OpenBabel.
- Consists of several sub-tools:
  - Energy Minimization: Conducts energy minimization on ligand molecules using OpenBabel.
  - Convert to PDBQT Format: Converts ligand molecules from .sdf format to .pdbqt format using OpenBabel.
  - Start Docking Process: Initiates the docking process using AutoDock Vina, allowing users to specify docking parameters and directories.
  - Split Output Files: Splits the output files generated by AutoDock Vina into individual docking poses and organizes them based on rank and score.

## Requirements

- Python 3.11
- Requests library (install via `pip install requests`)
- Colorama (install via `pip install colorama`)
