ResHelp Tools is a comprehensive toolkit designed to assist researchers in various tasks related to chemical data processing, docking simulations, and more. With a user-friendly interface and powerful functionalities, ResHelp Tools streamlines the workflow of researchers, making their work more efficient and productive.

## Features

- **PubChem Database Interaction:** Easily access and retrieve chemical data from the PubChem database.
- **IMPPAT Integration:** Fetch phytochemical associations and therapeutic use data using the IMPPAT database.
- **Add Hydrogen Tool:** Automatically add hydrogen atoms to SDF files and convert them to PDB format for molecular simulations.
- **Docking Automation:** Automate the docking process using OpenBabel and AutoDock Vina for molecular docking studies.

## Installation

To install ResHelp Tools on your system, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:** Begin by cloning the ResHelp Tools repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/manavc-13/ResHelp-Tools.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the Directory:** Move into the cloned directory:

    ```bash
    cd ResHelp-Tools
    ```

3. **Install Dependencies:** Install the required Python dependencies by running:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    If Python and pip are not installed on your system, you can install them by following these steps:

    ```bash
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install python3 python3-pip
    ```

    Ensure that you have Python installed on your system before proceeding with the installation.

4. **Update:** To get latest changes and updates to the program

    cd to the Repository folder in your system

    ```bash
    git pull
    ```

## Usage

Follow these steps to use ResHelp Tools effectively:

1. **Run the Main Program:**

   Execute the `main.py` file to access the main menu of ResHelp Tools:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Interact with the Tools:**

   - Upon launching the main program, you will be presented with a menu displaying the available actions.
   - Follow the on-screen instructions to perform actions such as selecting files, starting processes, and retrieving data.
   - Use the arrow keys or input the serial number of the action you want to perform.

3. **Docking Process:**

   - When using the docking functionality, ensure that the required ligand and protein files are present in the specified working directory.
   - Follow the prompts to minimize the energy of ligands, convert them to .pdbqt format, start the docking process, and split the output files into docking poses.

4. **Check Software Installation:**

   Before using certain features like docking, verify that OpenBabel and AutoDock Vina are installed on your system. If not, follow the prompts to install them during the first-time setup.
